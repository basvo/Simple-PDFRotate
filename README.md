# Simple-PDFRotate
Simple C# program for rotating PDF page orientation (not view, actual orientation) using iTextSharp.

### Usage:
Build and run. Browse for a file and click the button corresponding to the orientation you need. It will write a new file with the change of orientation.

Drag and drop support is also included (just drag a PDF onto the window and drop anywhere).

It will rotate all pages in the file. Split your file and remerge it, or you can add in an option to rotate specific pages (or wait for it to annoy me enough to).
